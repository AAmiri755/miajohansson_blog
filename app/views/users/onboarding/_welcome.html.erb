    <p style="margin-top: 8px; font-family: 'Playfair Display'"><i>❝ Throughout human history, our greatest leaders and thinkers have used
      the power of words to transform our emotions, to enlist us in their causes, and to
      shape the course of destiny. Words can not only create emotions, they create actions.
      And from our actions flow the results of our lives. ❞
