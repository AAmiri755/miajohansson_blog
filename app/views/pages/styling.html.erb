  <p class="question">What if I Want To Write Something That Doesn't Fit a Category? </p>
  <p>Most likely this is okay. To be safe you should email Mia at mia@theteenmagazine.com to confirm your idea. If it's about something that most teenage girls would find interesting, then it'll most likely be a good idea.</p>

  <p class="question">Can I write product reviews?</p>
  <p>Yes, but we limit these articles to only one for every three articles you write. Additionally, any review you write needs to be genuine and well thought out.</p>

  <p class="question">Can I include affiliate links?</p>
  <p>  Yes, but we limit these to 5 for every three articles you write. You could include all five in one article, or spread them out between the three. Affiliate links also need to be woven into your article. For example, you might say: "This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moroccanoil-Luminous-Hairspray-Strong-Ounce/dp/B007B3T47Y/ref=sr_1_cc_5_a_it?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1487554070&sr=1-5-catcorr&keywords=hairspray+for+hair">hairspray</a> is a must have because..." instead of "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moroccanoil-Luminous-Hairspray-Strong-Ounce/dp/B007B3T47Y/ref=sr_1_cc_5_a_it?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1487554070&sr=1-5-catcorr&keywords=hairspray+for+hair">Buy this hairspray</a>".</p>
