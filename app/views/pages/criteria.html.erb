  <p class="question">How long does it take for an article to be approved? </p>
  <p>It depends on the article. If there are very few mistakes it can take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days. If the article needs to be corrected by the editor or needs bigger changes, it can take up to five days to be either returned or published.</p>

  <p class="question">How long does it take for an article to be published? </p>
  <p>Usually when an article has been approved, it'll be published right away. Sometimes, however, it will be delayed by a few days if there have been many recently published articles.</p>

  <p class="question">How long should my article be? </p>
  <p>The perfect article length is around 500+ words. Shorter articles are okay too if they are filled with lots of images/gifs. </p>

  <p class="question">What does a published article consist of? </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">A published article...

  <p class="question">How often should I submit an article?</p>
  <p>Preferably, you should be uploading articles at least once every two weeks so that our site can stay active, but there are no official deadlines. However, if you can fit it into your schedule, we would love for you to write as many articles as you can.</p>

  <p class="question">What if I Want To Write Something That Doesn't Fit a Category? </p>
  <p>Most likely this is okay. To be safe you should email Sewon at sewonpark@college.harvard.edu to confirm your idea. If it's about something that most teenage girls would find interesting, then it'll most likely be a good idea.</p>

  <p class="question">Can I write product reviews?</p>
  <p>Yes, but we limit these articles to only one for every three articles you write. Additionally, any review you write needs to be genuine and well thought out.</p>

  <p class="question">Can I include affiliate links?</p>
  <p>  Yes, but we limit these to 5 for every three articles you write. You could include all five in one article, or spread them out between the three. Affiliate links also need to be woven into your article. For example, you might say: "This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moroccanoil-Luminous-Hairspray-Strong-Ounce/dp/B007B3T47Y/ref=sr_1_cc_5_a_it?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1487554070&sr=1-5-catcorr&keywords=hairspray+for+hair">hairspray</a> is a must have because..." instead of "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moroccanoil-Luminous-Hairspray-Strong-Ounce/dp/B007B3T47Y/ref=sr_1_cc_5_a_it?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1487554070&sr=1-5-catcorr&keywords=hairspray+for+hair">Buy this hairspray</a>".</p>
