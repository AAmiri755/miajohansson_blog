  <h3>Editor Onboarding & Monthly Assignments</h3>
  <p>Welcome to The Teen Magazine Editor Team! Our editors play an integral role in taking an idea to a published article on The Teen Magazine,
  and we are so happy that you applied to join this team of talented student writers.</p>
  <p>The Teen Magazine would not run without our editor team,
  and we truly want to thank you for all the time and devotion we've seen you put into being a writer, and now editor, for TTM.</p>
  <h4>As an Editor for The Teen Magazine:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You will be expected to remain an active member of our writer community and complete 10 new pitches and review at least 8 submitted articles every month. Reviews encompass any time that you move an article to "In Review" and either
    reject it with requested changes or approve it for publishing (more info in <a target="_blank" href="/article-requirements"><b>Reviewing Articles</b></a>).
    <li>You will receive your own <a target="_blank" href="/editors/<%= current_user.slug %>"><b>Editor Dashboard</b></a> along with your updated <a target="_blank" href="<%= user_path(id: current_user.slug, page: 'public') %>"><b>Editor Profile</b></a> which will keep track of how many writers you've directly helped at The Teen Magazine.
    <li>You will be able to view all writers and accept submitted profiles.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please make sure you've read through all the onboarding materials (also found on your editor dashboard) before reviewing any articles or submitted pitches.</p>
