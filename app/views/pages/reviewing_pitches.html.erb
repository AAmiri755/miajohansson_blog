  <h3>Reviewing Pitches</h3>

  <p>
    All newly pitched articles should be evaluated carefully before approving. The pitch must meet ALL the criteria as outlined below to be accepted.
    Always remember that it’s a lot better to reject a topic pitch before the article is written rather than rejecting an already-written article because it wasn’t written about a relevant topic. 
  </p>

  <p>Submitted pitches will show up under your "Editor Dashboard" under "New Pitched Articles." Click on "Review Pitch" to see the pitch's Editor Form.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">While reviewing a pitch, you should be considering these three questions:</span></p>

  <h3 id="first-question">1. Is the writer's argument for why this topic is relevant for The Teen Magazine's audience convincing?</h3>

  <p>
    An article is relevant to The Teen Magazine’s audience if it addresses a topic, experience, and/or problem that is felt by some or most teens. It is not enough for the article to be of interest to some teens just because the topic has such a broad audience already. If the article is a commentary about a current issue, it must contain some teenage perspective that makes it relevant and interesting to our audience (ie. Stock Market Analysis-Making a Good Investment is not suitable for The Teen Magazine while We Do Not Know What Protects Our Liberty and Why You Should Care is because it specifically addresses the teen reader, urging that “we need young, teen voters to be informed.” 
  </p>

  <h3 id="second-question">2. Is the title shareable and/or searchable?</h3>

  <p>A title is shareable if it is interesting and can reasonably spark curiosity and/or some other emotion. Some examples of shareable titles are "How Dressing Like Blair Waldorf Helped Me Take My SATs," "The Stages of All High School Relationships from an Outsider," "Why You Might Find It Hard to Make Deep Friendships," while vague, non-specific titles such as "Forgiveness is Freedom" should not be approved. If you you're not sure, use the headline analyzer tool found here: <a href="https://aminstitute.com/headline/"><b>https://aminstitute.com/headline/</b></a>. It is a good sign if the title has an Emotional Marketing Value (EMV) score of over 30. However, this measure is a tool, not the rule. Rely on your intuition and common sense more than the EMV score. </p>

  <p>
    A title is searchable if it contains keywords/phrases that would be reasonably typed into Google search. These titles are often questions, short responses, lists, etc. The topic should be specific enough that The Teen Magazine can come up in Google search (ie. “Cutest High School Romance Movies That Will Make You Cry” instead of “Best Netflix Movies”). 
  </p>

  <h3 id="third-question">3. Does the image thumbnail fit this topic well and is it good quality?</h3>

  <p>The thumbnail image should be relevant to the topic, not grainy, not cropped in a weird way, and not contain a mostly white background.</p>

  <p><b>If you answered yes to all three of these questions</b>, you may choose "Approved" from the dropdown menu and save.</p>

  <%= image_tag("pitch_review_form.png", class: "image_fit_scrn") %>

  <p><b>If you answered no to at least one of the questions</b>, select "Rejected", and mark the reason(s) why. Give further information about the decision in the comment box below. If you are unsure, either let another editor review this pitch or contact mia@theteenmagazine.com to ask a clarifying question about the pitch requirements.</p>
